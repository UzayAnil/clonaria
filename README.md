Clonaria
========

Clonaria is an open source sidescrolling block-based platformer like Terraria (http://terraria.org/) written in Python that is intended to serve as a fun programming exercise.  This is not meant to be "good" code; while cleaniness and flexibility are secondary goals, the primary focus is on learning and exploring, and much of the code is the result of little but trial and error.  The original Java version of Clonaria has been renamed to Clonaria-Java.
