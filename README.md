Clonaria
========

Clonaria is an open source sidescrolling block-based platformer like Terraria (http://terraria.org/) written in Python that is intended to serve as a fun programming exercise and learning experience.  This is not meant to be "good" code; while cleaniness and flexibility are secondary goals, the primary focus is on learning and exploring, and much of the code is the result of little but trial and error.  If this project interests you, feel free to make a pull request.

The original Java version of Clonaria has been renamed to Clonaria-Java and will not be updated any further.
